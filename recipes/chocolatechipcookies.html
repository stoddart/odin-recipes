  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the Oven:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line two or three baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Mix Dry Ingredients:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Cream Butter and Sugars:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the
        mixture is light and fluffy.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Add Eggs and Vanilla:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract, mixing until well combined.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Combine Mixtures:</li>

    </ul>
    <li>Shape Cookies:</li>

      <li>Using a cookie scoop or your hands, roll 2-3 tablespoons of dough into balls and place them on the prepared
        baking sheets, leaving space between each cookie.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Bake:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden but the centers are still
        soft.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Cool:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to
        cool completely.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>

  <h2>Tips</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>For extra flavor, consider adding a sprinkle of flaky sea salt on top of the cookies before baking.</li>
    <li>If you prefer a thicker cookie, you can refrigerate the dough for about 30 minutes before baking.</li>
  </ul>
