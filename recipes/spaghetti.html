  <h1>Spaghetti Bolognese</h1>

  <img src="../images/spaghetti.webp" alt="Spaghetti Bolognese" width="500" height="500">

  <p>Spaghetti Bolognese is a classic Italian dish that combines the familiar elements of spaghetti with a rich, hearty
    meat sauce known as "ragù alla Bolognese." While traditional spaghetti is typically served with a variety of sauces,
    Bolognese sauce has its own unique characteristics that set it apart. The sauce is the star of the dish and is made
    from a combination of ground meat (usually beef or pork), onions, carrots, celery, garlic, and tomatoes.
    It is slow-cooked to develop deep flavors and is often enriched with red wine and milk or cream, giving it a creamy
    texture.</p>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the Vegetables:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the diced onion, carrots, and celery.
        Cook for about 5 minutes until softened.

    <ul>
      <li>Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute. Add the minced beef and pork (if using), along with the

    </ul>
    <li>Incorporate Tomato and Wine:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Add the tomato paste and stir well to combine. Pour in the red wine and let it simmer for about 2-3 minutes to

    <ul>
      <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, crumbled stock cube, oregano, thyme, and brown sugar.

    </ul>
    <li>Cook the Spaghetti:</li>

        pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain the pasta.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Combine and Serve:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Serve the spaghetti topped with the bolognese sauce. Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs if
        desired.</li>

  </ol>

  <h2>Tips for Best Results</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Long Simmering Time:</strong> The longer you allow the sauce to simmer, the richer the flavors will
      become. Aim for a minimum of 90 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality Ingredients:</strong> Use good quality minced meat and tomatoes for the best flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Freezing:</strong> This recipe makes a large batch, perfect for freezing. Allow the sauce to cool before
      storing it in airtight containers for future meals.</li>
